## üìÇ Project Overview

This project is divided into two key parts:
1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Explore the dataset with meaningful visualizations.
   - Analyze key features such as top-rated books, authors, and average ratings.
2. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine using the `Surprise` library.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Details

- The dataset includes columns such as:
  - `book_id`: Unique identifier for books.
  - `title`: Book title.
  - `authors`: Author(s) of the book.
  - `language`: Language in which the book is written.
  - `rating`: User ratings of the book.

## ‚ú® Visualizations

### Key Insights Explored
1. **Top 20 Books**:
   - Bar chart showcasing the most popular books based on ratings.
2. **Language Distribution**:
   - Pie chart representing the distribution of books by language.
3. **Most Rated Books**:
   - Highlight books with the highest number of ratings.
4. **Highly Rated Authors**:
   - Explore authors with the highest average ratings.
5. **Authors with Most Books**:
   - Visualize prolific authors with the largest number of published books.
6. **Rating Distribution**:
   - Histogram showing the distribution of ratings across ranges (e.g., 1‚Äì2, 2‚Äì3, etc.).
7. **Feature Relationships**:
   - Pair plots visualizing relationships between numerical features.

# Book Recommender System

This project is a **Book Recommender System** built using various recommendation techniques such as **Content-Based Filtering**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and a **Hybrid Approach**. The system recommends books based on user preferences and interactions. The project also includes extensive data visualization to provide insights into the book dataset.

## Project Overview

The project leverages data from a CSV file containing book details such as book names, authors, ratings, and more. Using this data, the following recommendation techniques are implemented:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**
2. **Collaborative Filtering**
3. **Hybrid Recommendation System**

Additionally, the project includes data visualizations to explore the dataset and gain insights into the books' distribution and ratings.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Top 20 books by rating.
  - Distribution of books by language.
  - Most-rated books.
  - Highly-rated authors.
  - Authors with the most books.
  - Rating distribution from 1 to 5.
  - Relationship visualizations between numeric features.

- **Recommendation Techniques**:
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends books based on metadata (e.g., book title, author, etc.).
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interactions (user ratings) to predict ratings and recommend books.
  - **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.
